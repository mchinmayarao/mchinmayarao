### Projects

### Projects


1. 📱 **MetaMind: AI Tools Collection Android App** - An Android app that includes a collection of AI tools for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and sentiment analysis.

2. 📈 **LSTM Model for Arecanut Price Prediction** - Developed an LSTM-based machine learning model using TensorFlow to predict the price of arecanut, a crop commonly grown in certain regions. The model utilizes historical price data for accurate predictions.

3. 🦟 **MalariaDetector: MATLAB Image Processing** - Developed a standalone script and a MATLAB app for detecting and diagnosing malaria from microscope images. The script leverages image processing techniques to identify malaria parasites in blood smear images.

4. 🧩 **SmartSudokuSolver: Python Sudoku Solver** - Created a Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles from images. The code uses computer vision techniques to extract the puzzle from the image, solves it using an algorithm, and overlays the solution onto the original image.
